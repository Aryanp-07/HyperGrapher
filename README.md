## Introduction
Data visualization is the process of representing data in a graphical or pictorial form, making it easier to understand, analyse and communicate to others. In today's data-driven world, where vast amounts of data are generated every second, data visualization plays a critical role in extracting valuable insights and making data-driven decisions. It helps in identifying patterns, trends, and relationships, which might not be evident from the raw data. With the increasing volume of data generated by various sources, data visualization has become an essential tool for businesses, researchers, educators, and governments to make informed decisions. The process of data visualization involves the use of various graphical representations such as charts, graphs, maps, and infographics to convey complex information in a simplified manner.

Data visualization is an essential tool for businesses, researchers, educators, and governments to make data-driven decisions. The goal of this project is to develop a data visualization tool using Java programming language, which will provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to upload, manipulate, and visualize data in various forms.

## Architecture
The MVC architecture, or Model-View-Controller architecture, is a design pattern commonly used in web development to separate an application into three distinct components: the Model, the View, and the Controller.

Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. In our project, the Model is responsible for fetching data from the CSV file and processing it so that it can be used by the View component. The Model is also responsible for updating and modifying the data, such as when the user makes changes to a visualization.

View: The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user in a way that is understandable and easy to interact with. In our project, the View is the user interface that displays the charts and visualizations created using the Chart.js library. The View communicates with the Controller to make changes to the data or request new data to be displayed.

Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View components. It receives input from the user and updates the Model accordingly. The Controller also receives requests from the View to modify the data and updates the View with the appropriate changes. In our project, the Controller is responsible for receiving user input and passing it to the Model to make changes to the data. It is also responsible for updating the View with the appropriate changes based on user input
